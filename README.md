# Odin Project - JavaScript - Rock Paper Scissors - Old Version

This is the old version of Rock Paper Scissors, which doesn't come with an UI. You can switch to the new version by selecting the `main` branch in GitHub.

To start the game call the `game()` Function from your JavaScript Console.

## Why is this Version in an seperate Branch?
I used a different approach to send the `PlayerSelection` data, because of that the `game()` Function stopped working, so I deleted it entirely from `main`. 

I will probably add an ability to play the game through the console again, but currently my main objective is to create an simple UI with DOM Manipulation. If I end up adding it again it will be merged into `main`, and this Branch will be deleted.
